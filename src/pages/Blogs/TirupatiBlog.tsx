                                        Perched atop the seven hills of Seshachalam in Andhra Pradesh, the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple is often called "Kaliyuga Vaikuntha"—the earthly abode of Lord Vishnu in this age. It is the most visited holy place in the world, receiving 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims daily.
                                    </p>

                                            The story begins with Sage Bhrigu kicking Lord Vishnu on the chest. Goddess Lakshmi, residing in Vishnu's chest, felt insulted and left Vaikuntha to meditate on Earth. Vishnu, unable to bear the separation, descended to Earth as Srinivasa.
                                        </p>

                                            He lived in an anthill and was fed by a cow (which was Brahma in disguise). Eventually, he met Padmavathi, the daughter of Akasha Raja, and fell in love. Their celestial wedding is the foundation of the Tirumala temple's glory.

                                        <p className="mb-4">
                                            For his grand wedding to Padmavathi, Srinivasa had no wealth. He approached **Kubera**, the God of Wealth, for a loan. Kubera agreed, but on a condition that the loan would be repaid with interest until the end of the Kali Yuga.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This is why millions of devotees donate money and gold into the Hundi (donation box) at Tirupati. They believe they are helping the Lord repay his debt. In return, the Lord grants them prosperity multifold.

                                            A unique custom at Tirupati is tonsuring—shaving one's head. The legend says that when Srinivasa was hit by a shepherd on his head, a portion of his hair was cut. **Neela Devi**, a Gandharva princess, witnessed this and immediately cut her own lustrous hair to implant it on the Lord's head.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Touched by her sacrifice, Lord Srinivasa blessed her saying that hair is the most beautiful asset of a human. Anyone who sacrifices their hair at his feet will be blessed, and the hair will reach Neela Devi.
                                        </p>
